	printf("You are currently floating in an endless void. \
It seems as if your usual ways of being in the world aren\'t going \
to be much use here. To help with the adjustment, you\'ve been left \
some programs. \
These will help you ease into using commands instead of \
clicking stuff.\n\
You should be reading this on a mostly empty screen where you \
can only type on a single line. This screen is the terminal.\n\
For now, think of it like a way of having a conversation directly\
 with your computer. The line you can type on is called the \
command line. You can write a command here to get your computer \
to do something. Running a program here is a lot like doing it \
in other environments like a smartphone or pc. You just select it\
! As you can\'t use your mouse or touchscreen here, you can do that by \
typing ./ and the program\'s name. Why not try running the program \
called remember? Just type ./remember and push enter.\n");
