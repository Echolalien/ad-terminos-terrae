self yet, but you feel grounded enough to have a go at inspecting this \
void and seeing what other programs you have access to. Perhaps it\'s \
time to make a quick list of programs available here in the void by \
using the ls command. Up until now you've been running programs, but ls \
is a command, which means it doesn\'t need ./ in front of it to run. \
When you\'re ready to make that list, type ls and press enter.\n");
