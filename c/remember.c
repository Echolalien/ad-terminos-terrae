the same five people every day, avoiding eye contact with people dying in \
the street because it\'s not like you can help them anyway. Then govcorp \
collapsed and took the old world with it. Still, no point in dwelling. \
You remember you have another program saved here that might help you ground \
yourself back in reality. The program is called ground. You remember how to \
run programs, right? You definitely DO remember that you can hold shift then \
push pageup and pagedown to scroll through the terminal history, which should \
help remind you of anything you HAVE forgotten.\n");
