walking along East street, thinking about an old friend. Didn\'t you \
hear something that startled you? Ah yes, one of the fabric sellers was \
moving their cart when it threw a wheel on a paving crack. The whole \
thing collapsed with a crash and you were thrown into a flashback \
which we really don\'t need to get into right now. With your restored \
emotional clarity, you recall a pair of kind souls leading you away from \
the bustle of the market, Eastwards. And then... nothing. The void of \
dissociation and having your eyes shut and ears covered. If you/'re \
ready to step back into London, you can move forward knowing the safety \
of the void is always behind you. To move forward, you can use the \
change directory command to enter the london directory. Just type cd \
London. Be aware that when you move to a new directory, your programs \
don\'t move with you. Once you\'re back in London you\'ll only have \
access to commands like ls and cd, and any new programs you can find \
there. Don\'t forget about using shift+pageup to look back over \
your terminal history if you get stuck!\n");
