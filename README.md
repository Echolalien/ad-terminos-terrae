# ad-terminos-terrae
ATT is a terminal based text adventure game to teach people to use terminal. It's a story about a post apocralyptic London. Right now it's in testing but the eventual goal is a single makefile to install the game (file structure).

In Spring 2019 Dave King, Jonny Thaw and I were talking about accessible ways of teaching terminal usage to complete beginners and I floated the idea of making a treasure hunt filesystem. We kicked around a few ideas about what that'd look like, but it was Jonny who actually made that idea a reality. He made a really fab game using node for doing just that. It goes way beyond what we'd discussed and is a brilliant intro to moving through directories and running node apps. It can be downloaded here https://github.com/jthawme/node_treasure_hunt
Many of the mechanical ideas in here owe their origins to that treasure hunt and to Jonny and Dave.

In Summer 2019 I attended Jorid Jonland's How We Saved the World, a speculative fictioning LARP about avoiding a human-induced apocalypse which she was running as part of her master's thesis in playable experience design. A lot of the tonal and thematic elements of this game are lifted from conversations I had during the game or that she'd written as background. We've also been having conversations for years about what a solarpunk future would look like so her input in this project is very significant. I just added a little lesbian postgender privitivist romanticisation to the mix ;)
