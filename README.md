ATT is a terminal based text adventure game to teach people to use terminal. It's a story about a post apocralyptic London. Right now it's in testing but the eventual goal is a single makefile to install the game (file structure).

In Spring 2019 Dave King, Jonny Thaw and I were talking about accessible ways of teaching terminal usage to complete beginners and I floated the idea of making a treasure hunt filesystem. We kicked around a few ideas about what that'd look like, but it was Jonny who actually made that idea a reality. He made a really fab game using node for doing just that. It goes way beyond what we'd discussed and is a brilliant intro to moving through directories and running node apps. It can be downloaded here https://github.com/jthawme/node_treasure_hunt
